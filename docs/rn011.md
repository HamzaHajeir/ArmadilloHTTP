# New features

* All the http: methods are now `virtual` to allow greater flexibility in sub-classes. For example [H4/Pluigins](https://github.com/philbowles/h4plugins) silently ignores the calls if there is no WiFi connection.
* "Lockout prevention" of overlapping requests has been made a) more robust b) simpler for subclasses to manage / control
